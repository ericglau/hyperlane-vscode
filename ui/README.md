# Hyperlan VS Code UI

This UI is built to support the deployment of Contracts with Hyperlane. 
It helps to generate config files: `chains.json` and `multisig_ism.json` 
in order to support the automation of the deployment.

## Available Scripts

Install dependencies:
### `npm install`

Start the UI on localhost:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Build the UI app:
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
